// ARRAY SECTION
// Task 1 [1.5]
// Create an array called truths and store 3 true facts about yourself

// Create a second array called lies and store 3 fake facts about yourself

// Task 2 [1.5]
// Console log the 1st element of the truths array (element is not same as index!)

// Change the value of the last element in the truths to another fact

// Console log the last element to check that it's changed

// Task 3 [1.5]
// Delete the first value from the lies array

// Add a new lie to the end of the lies array

// Console log the lies list to confirm the changes

// Task 4 [1.4]
// Use string concatenation or template literals to print "I have [number] facts." 
// You should plug in the length of truths in the square brackets for number

// Task 5 [1.5]
// Prompt the user to enter 0, 1, or 2 and save it in a variable called index

// Cast index to be a number

// Task 5 [1.5]
let randomNumber = Math.random()

if (randomNumber < 0.5){
    // console log the element at index from the truths array

} else {
    // console log the element at index from the lies array

}
// Prompt the user to guess if it's true or false

if (randomNumber < 0.5){
   console.log("It was the truth!")

    console.log("It was not the truth!")

// Commit your changes with an appropriate message.
// ----------------------------------
// OBJECTS SECTION
// Task 7 [1.5]
// Create a variable called user1 with the keys username (any string), password (any string), friendCount (any number), and isOnline (false).

// Console log the profile's username

// Task 8 [1.5]
// Make the friend count go up by 1

// Console log the profile's friendCount to check if the value updated

// Task 9 [1.6]
// Prompt the user to enter their password

// If the user's password is correct, console log "Welcome " + username and set their isOnline to true

// Task 10 [1.5]
// Add a status key to the user1 object and set it to null

// Prompt the user to enter a status and save it in a variable

// Set the status key to be the user's input

// Commit your changes with an appropriate message.
// Push the changes if you are ready to submit.
// ----------------------------------
// EXTRA CREDIT
// Add a truths key to the user1 object and set it equal to an empty array

// Do the same for the lies key

// Ask the user for a fact about them and add it to the user1 truths key (not the array above!)

// Ask the user for a fake fact about them and add it to the user1 truths key (not the array above!)

// Set up a similar guessing game as in the array section. 
// Note, you can skip the prompt about picking 0-2 since you only have 1 truth/lie.
